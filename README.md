> A place for publishing new versions of (some) stan-dev R packages before they reach CRAN and for stan-dev R packages and versions where releasing on CRAN is not a (current) goal. As of 2021-03-16 this is most relevant for rstan, where the CRAN version is unfortunately several releases behind and pushing a new version to CRAN has been difficult.

## 1. Soccer Scores Modelling

  Initially I collected soccer odds data of 40 bookmakers (in Excel format) and compare the efficiency and accuracy. I tried to submit the spreadsheets to [Ladbrokes](https://www.ladbrokescoralplc.com/) in order to get the trading department when I worked in [Scicom (MSC) Bhd](http://www.scicom-intl.com/).

- Learn the knowledge in sportsbook from tip-to-toe as you can know via [®γσ, ξηg Lian Hu](https://englianhu.wordpress.com/).
- Collect the livescore and also 1x2, Asian Handicap, Over Under odds price data of 29 sportsbookmakers manually from 500WAN, BET007 and NowGoal website and filter the odds price data from 2006 to 2011.
- Apply Poisson model in R to test the return of the investment. This research job is the most completed, success and the first research which write the whole odds compilation EM model and data management by refer to thousands of research papers in sportsbook odds modelling after resigned from Caspo Inc.

`Rmodel` which compile the index of soccer teams and predict the soccer scores. Odds modelling for 1x2, Asian Handicap, Over Under, Correct Score, Half-Time Full-Time etc.
